# Frontend Environment Variables
# Copy this file to .env and update values as needed

# Backend API URL
# Default: /api/export (relative path, works with Vite proxy)
# For development with separate backend server, use full URL:
VITE_API_URL=http://localhost:4000/api/export

# Note: In Vite, all environment variables must be prefixed with VITE_
# to be exposed to the client-side code.
